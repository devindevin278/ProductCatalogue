# About This Website

This is a web application where customer, especially wibu, can find their favourite gundam. Currently, the gundam consists of three different categories: R, SR and SSR. The R ones have silver card color, while the SR are gold in color and the SSR are red.

In the making of this website, I make the use of @yield, @foreach, @if directive from Blade templating engine. Besides, I also implement two controllers, they are ProductController and MethodController.
